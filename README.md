### Hello there, dear internet surfer! 🏄‍
Welcome to my github profile, this is the backend of all my works.
_Yes, you got it, where all of that nerdy magic happens 😏_

I am currently working on many commercial projects, which is why you don't see many repos here.
Mostly, the public repositories that you can find on my profile have to do with sience or astronomy.

### But hey, I haven't presented myself yet! Let me fix that:

- 👨‍⚕️ I am Mattia, but you can call me Matt, I am a Computer Science student in Amsterdam.
- 🤑 I am currently freelancing as a webdeveloper. 
- 🐍 But sometimes I also love to go offline and develop some good old local software, for that purpose I use my beloved python language.

Still interested? Surf a little further on my website then: https://mattiapeiretti.com/, see you there!


### My skills:

- Coming soon!
